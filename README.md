# Marketing-Campaigns
This project focuses on analyzing marketing data to uncover insights into customer behavior and improve acquisition strategies. The dataset includes variables related to demographics, spending habits, and campaign performance. Key steps include cleaning missing data, creating features like age and total spending, and visualizing data distributions to detect outliers. Categorical variables were encoded, and correlation analysis was performed using heatmaps. Hypotheses such as the influence of age on shopping preferences and the impact of children on online shopping were tested. Visualizations highlighted top-performing products, campaign acceptance rates, and spending trends. The analysis provides actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies, enhance product offerings, and better understand customer preferences for improved decision-making.
